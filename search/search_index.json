If you want to know how the mod works, you can open the tabs on the left for the specific feature. This is an addon for ComputerCraft . The mod exists to add blocks, turtles and many more to ComputerCraft for extended features. ComputerCraft is a big mod, you can program various things with the language Lua. You could print a simple message on a monitor or create a program which controls your carrot farm. I want to explain the basics of ComputerCraft and how it works here.

Computers, Peripherals and Monitors \u00b6 The device which you use to program scripts to control your carrot farm is the computer . You can use the command edit in it to create or edit existing scripts. Peripherals are computers, but peripherals are monitors too. What are peripherals now? A peripheral is everything you can connect with a modem from ComputerCraft. With the modem you can connect a monitor, a computer, a chat box or another peripheral with each other to use it in your ComputerCraft script. If you have connected a peripheral, you can wrap it with the peripheral API . 1 monitor = peripheral . wrap ( \"monitor_0\" ) So, you connected your first monitor. What now? Now you can print a simple text on the monitor to display useful information. We want to print the text \"Hey world\" First we should clear the monitor to clear old text.

This is when fuel consuming rate come to help! Bigger fuel consuming rate will reduce cooldown, but obviously increate fuel consumption. For example, if click operation required 1 fuel point for perform and will have 5 seconds cooldown, with fuel consumption 2 you can perform click operation one in 2.5 seconds, but in cost of 2 fuel point.

This is when fuel consuming rate come to help! Bigger fuel consuming rate will reduce cooldown, but obviously increate fuel consumption. For example, if click operation required 1 fuel point for perform and will have 5 seconds cooldown, with fuel consumption 2 you can perform click operation one in 2.5 seconds, but in cost of 2 fuel point.

Integrated Dynamics Integration \u00b6 We added a peripheral to the \"Variable Store\" Block from Integrated Dynamics to read variables from integrated dynamics. This new feature is a mod integration, you can see here how you can use these new features. Storage Drawer Integration \u00b6 You can now access storage drawers. Store items, push items, pull items or does what ever you want to do with items. This new feature is a mod integration, you can see here how you can use these new features. Geo Scanner \u00b6 The Geo Scanner provides information about blocks around him and the chunk of the geo scanner. You could use it to search in the near or analyze ores in a chunk. Block Reader \u00b6 With the Block Reader you can read data of blocks and tile entites. You can simply place the blocks in front of it to access it. NBT Storage \u00b6 With this block, you're able to store tables or other values. You can simply read and write values with the functions of it. Take a look at the documentation . New Turtles Upgrades \u00b6 New powerful turtle upgrades! With this small upgrades you finally can use any tools just from turtle inventories, perform right click on blocks, collect items in small range, transport animals and much more! But be aware, the new abilities require fuel and most of them have a cooldown. Big thanks to SirEdvin who made this upgrades. New Ingame Documentation \u00b6 Advanced Peripherals does now use Patchouli to generate an ingame documentation. You can now easy get help without the need of an internet browser. Small features and improvements \u00b6 This update also provides a lot of small features and improvements New functions, events and other features \u00b6 Here is a list of some new additions Added the slot parameter to the functions of the inventory manager. Added the parameter uuid and isHidden to the chat event. Added a lot of new functions to the Player Detector . We changed some function names of the ME and RS Bridge, be warned.
